# BioPython-SmallProjects

Welcome to BioPython-SmallProjects!  
This repository is a collection of small and simple bioinformatics projects implemented in Python.  
New projects will be added over time, and future projects may also include R.

The goal of this repository is to provide easy-to-follow examples for learning bioinformatics coding and analysis, suitable for students and researchers alike.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder and contains:

- README.md → explains the project, shows results, and provides instructions.  
- Code files (.py, .R, etc.) → scripts used for the analysis.  
- Data files (.txt, .csv, etc.) → input data for the project.  
- Figures (if any) → visualizations generated by the code.
